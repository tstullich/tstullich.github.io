<p>I am currently working on building out a deferred renderer using Vulkan and Dear ImGui. My intent
is to improve my knowledge around Vulkan and realtime rendering, while also providing
a way for others to see what it&rsquo;s like building a renderer from scratch. I plan to publish
the source code so that others can freely use it and extend code if they wish.</p>
<p>Follow the development on <a href="https://github.com/tstullich/renderer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Github</a> or through my <a href="/posts/" rel="">blog posts</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2-odin---a-vulkan-based-path-tracer">2. Odin - A Vulkan-based Path Tracer</h2>
<p><code>C++</code> <code>GLSL</code> <code>Vulkan</code> <code>Realtime Rendering</code> <code>Shaders</code></p>
<p>This project was my first step into getting my feet wet with the Vulkan API. When NVIDIA
announced their first GPU series featuring the
<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/turing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Turing architecture</a>, I decided to test if it was
possible to write a real-time raytracing application without a dedicated GPU.</p>
<p>The renderer uses a single compute shader to perform the path tracing algorithm and write the result
into a texture image which can be sampled from the graphics pipeline. It also sports the following
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for diffuse, caustic, and dielectric materials</li>
<li>Tracing of geometry serialized in the OBJ file format</li>
<li>A basic Bounding Volume Hierarchy using axis-aligned bounding boxes</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the implementation is still quite bottlenecked due to the fact that there are a lot of branching
instructions, which only lets the renderer run at around 10-20 FPS on my hardware. If I could spend some
time optimizing my shader code, I could envision the renderer having more practical applications.</p>

<p>As a challenge to myself to learn Rust, I decided to adapt Peter Shirley&rsquo;s
<a href="https://raytracing.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Raytracing In One Weekend</a> tutorial, which is written in C++, into a
Rust application. All of the features from the first book are available including some extras:</p>
<ul>
<li>OBJ model parsing or randomized scene creation</li>
<li>Support for configurable dielectric, diffuse, and caustic materials</li>
<li>Motion blur</li>
<li>Checkered textures support</li>
<li>Configuring of rendering parameters through command line arguments</li>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For my Master&rsquo;s thesis I decided to explore differentiable rendering, which combines machine learning
with computer graphics. For a good explanation on the topic I encourage you to watch
Wenzel Jakob&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prZJ8FBG9BI&amp;t=1895s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Keynote Speech</a>
during the High Performance Graphics 2020 conference.</p>
<p>In my case, I chose to extend the capabilities of the differentiable renderer <code>redner</code>, which was
introduced by Li et al. in the paper <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/tzumao/diffrt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Differentiable
Monte Carlo Ray Tracing through Edge Sampling</a>,
to be able to optimize homogeneous participating media.</p>
<p>The figure above shows one of the test setups that was used to verify the code that I had written.
The perturbed scene on the left-hand side is enveloped in a thick fog and the goal of the test run
was to remove the fog entirely by optimizing the scene towards the target image on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>The result of running the gradient descent optimization can be seen in the figure below. The fog has been
nearly removed from the perturbed image, with some visual artifacts remaining in the tree line in the
background.</p>

<p><code>OpenGL</code> <code>Qt5</code> <code>Data Structures</code> <code>Surface Reconstruction</code> <code>Implicit Surfaces</code></p>
<p>The Computer Graphics 2 course taught a number of different techniques focused around geometric reconstruction
and implicit surfaces. All of the assignments focused on a particular topic within those domains and were completed in collaboration with two group members. For the coding portions of the assignments we
used OpenGL to perform our graphics computations, with Qt5 acting as the framework for the demos&rsquo; user
interface. Qt5 allowed us to dynamically adjust the parameters for the various demonstrations.
What follows are some of the highlights of the course.</p>
<h3 id="k-d-trees-with-nearest-neighbor-point-search">K-d Trees With Nearest Neighbor Point Search</h3>

            <p>The k-d tree data structure being used to perform k-nearest neighbor search on a point cloud</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This assignment revolved around building a k-d tree data structure, which acts as a binary tree data structure
for k-dimensional point sets. This is accomplished by partitioning the k-dimensional (k=3 in our
case) spatial domain into a half-space. To find a dividing plane for the half-space, the points in
our data sets were sorted using a quicksort algorithm, which I implemented from scratch for efficient sorting.</p>
<p>The k-d tree was then used in our application to implement a N-Nearest Neighbor Search algorithm to collect
an arbitrary set of points near a point in space. The image above shows how a user can select a point in the
data set, and the nearest neighbor search then gathers of a preset amount of points in its neighborhood.
The selected point is highlighted in pink and the n-closest points (N=1617) are shown in green.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This assignment focused on surface reconstruction using the marching cubes algorithm. From the implicit
surface representation, shown in the above image, a 3D cube is <em>marched</em> along an adjustable fixed
grid. At each step, we test what parts of the cube&rsquo;s surface is inside or outside of the volume by
intersecting a set of 256 precomputed triangle configurations with the surface. If an intersection is
found, a triangle is constructed through the three intersection points of the cube with the surface
and added to a mesh data structure.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One such mesh, which was created after one run of the marching cubes algorithm, can be seen above. Although
the mesh is not a perfect representation of the surface, it is possible to create finer approximations
by adjusting the grid subdivision and tuning the nearest neighbor search parameters.</p>

</figure>

<p>The very first course that I took for computer graphics was the CG 1 course taught at the
Technical University Berlin. This was an introductory course which covered a classical forward
rendering pipeline from front to back. Among the topics covered were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scene graph representations and linear transformations</li>
<li>Camera projections</li>
<li>Texture mapping</li>
<li>Various shading techniques (Gourad, Phong, etc.)</li>
<li>Color theory</li>
</ul>
<p>The final assignment for the course is what convinced me to focus on rendering. The
assignment let us write a ray tracer in WebGL which produced the output image seen above.
The simplicity of the ray tracing algorithm, along with the stunning output it provides
drove me to learn more about the subject and soon enough I was deep into the rabbit hole on rendering.</p>

<p><code>C++</code> <code>Scientific Writing</code> <code>IoT</code> <code>Sensor Networks</code></p>
<p>During my time as a Student Research Assistant with the Database Systems and Information Management Group
at the Technical University in Berlin, I got the chance to work on a demonstration paper that was presented
at the <em>Extending Database Technology</em> conference in 2019. The work was focused on recording and
replaying sensor data on IoT devices. The abstract for the paper has been cited below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the scientific interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, emulating IoT infrastructure
involving a large number of heterogeneous sensors plays a crucial role. Existing research on emulating
sensors is often tailored to specific hardware and/or software, which makes it difficult to reproduce and
extend. In this paper we show how to emulate different kinds of sensors in a unified way that makes
the downstream application agnostic as to whether the sensor data is acquired from real sensors is read
from memory using emulated sensors. We propose the Resense framework that allows for replaying sensor
data using emulated sensors and provides an easy-to-use software for setting up and executing IoT
experiments involving a large number of heterogeneous sensors. We demonstrate various aspects of
Resense in the context of a sports analytics application using real-world sensor data and a set
of Raspberry Pis.</p>
