their graveyard of unfinished side projects. In my particular case,
I was scrolling through my Github profile, taking stock of all of the repositories that I have not committed
code to in over a year, and the total came out to be a staggering <strong>40</strong> repositories. To me, this is not a great
stat, considering I have been actively committing to just <strong>3</strong> repositories in the last year.</p>

<p>The number of repositories with flatlined commit pulses serve as a reminder of all the different ideas
I have had over the years, which eventually ended up dying off for one reason or another. Some would say this is a
normal occurence for side projects. They are after all just side projects, which should only be worked on as long as one
enjoys it. While I agree with this notion, I cannot help but be frustrated with myself, that I was not able to see some
of these projects through to the end, for I believe they would have had some intrinsic worth to someone one way or another.
Or this is just my complaint to Github&rsquo;s UX team for giving repositories human-like qualities with their commit ECG line,
leading me to become too emotionally attached to my projects.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am being a little harsh on myself, because not all of the repositories I counted are incomplete. Some repositories
I left because they were <em>finished</em> for a lack of a better word. I determined there was nothing more to be worked on, so I moved
on to create something else. But this recent scroll through my Github profile has served to spark my interest in writing
down some of my thoughts in regards to side projects and how motivation can make or break one. In addition, I am also going
to briefly touch on another project I have planned and why you should stick around for further content.</p>

<h2 id="failure-to-launch">Failure To Launch</h2>
<p>To understand why motivation is a big factor in bringing a side project to completion, I would like to approach this subject by
talking about about some elements that can influence motivation. The following elements tend to negatively influence my mindset before
and during my work on a side project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perceived payoff</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Knowledge on the subject matter</li>
</ol>
<p>While these factors do not capture a complete list, nor are they mutually exclusive, I have identified them to be the most
detrimental to my own motivation. In the following paragraphs, I will touch on some of my thoughts as to how these influences arise and how
I try to overcome them.</p>
<h3 id="perceived-payoff-why-does-it-even-matter">Perceived Payoff (Why Does It Even Matter?)</h3>
<p>The question of <em>why</em> to even start a side project comes up almost every time I get an idea in my head to work on something new.
I used to have this preconceived notion in my head, that if my work does not produce something tangible to another person, then
it is not worth starting at all. Why would should I try and write another renderer, mobile app, parser, etc. when there are tons of
other projects out there that do this very thing already and better? Nobody is going to take a look at my newest side project, because
I am just some guy on the internet who is just trying to fly by the seam of his pants.</p>
<p>Pressuring myself into thinking that I had to care about anyone&rsquo;s opinion but my own is what caused me to burn out quickly
on any project and it took me quite some time to realize, that I needed to shift my mindset around and instead focus my side projects
towards myself. Instead of asking myself if my project had any worth to someone else, I started asking myself what does
this project do for <em>me</em>?  Does it help me learn a new subject matter that I was not familiar with? Do I get to build something
cool just for the sake of me thinking it&rsquo;s cool?</p>
<p>This change in mentality is what has helped me find a lot more enjoyment in trying out a new SDK or implementing parts of an
article that I read online.</p>
<h3 id="time-management-just-let-it-go-from-time-to-time">Time Management (Just Let It Go From Time To Time)</h3>
<p>Managing time to work on a side project can be challenging. Most of us have very limited time in the day to spend on writing
code due to work, family, good weather, etc. This means that free time is precious and needs to be spent wisely. The approach
I used to take in college was to have a set schedule and allocate some time in the evening to work on my projects. Often this meant
working later into the night than I wanted to, sacrificing sleep over some features to add to my mobile app. This worked well
during my time as a student, when I had lectures to catch up on sleep (I know I am not a great student 😅), but now
that I have graduated from university my schedule has shifted. I now have to dedicate most of my time during the week to coding at a job,
so I cannot look at code when I get home during the week. My motivation for writing code cannot be lower than after having programmed
all day at my job.</p>
<p>I know there are people out there that love coding, so much that they can do it even after having just done a 9-5 day programming.
I have a lot of respect for these people, but I am not the kind of person. I need to exercise, enjoy the outdoors, and pursue some other
hobbies that are not in front of my computer.</p>
<p>So how do I manage my free time to work on a side project? Nowadays, I work on projects when the mood strikes me. If I have some time
on the weekend where I usually get these bursts of creative energy, I get on my computer and write some code until I feel I have had enough.
Sometimes that&rsquo;s just 30 minutes, sometimes that can be multiple hours at a time - and that&rsquo;s fine. Now that I have gotten older, I
have realized that I should not stress myself out too much, when I do not see lots of progress on a project. As the saying goes
&ldquo;Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day&rdquo;, so do I approach my side projects.</p>
<p>To further drive home this point, the XKCD comic below demonstrates that unless you are on the level of <a href="https://twitter.com/ocornut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Omar Cornut</a>,
whatever you are working on in your free time can wait (trust me, it&rsquo;s not that important).</p>

<h2 id="a-new-hope">A New Hope</h2>
<p>So why did I just spend all this time trying to talk about motivation and side projects? Well, you might have guessed it - I am
starting a new side project! This also ties into the title of this post, because I am going to attempt to once again try and
write a real-time physically-based renderer, which I have began and abandoned due to all of the negative factors I just discussed.
However, this time things will be different (famous last words&hellip;). I have been able to enlist a colleague and friend of mine
who is going to help me see things through. I also want to take this project to help share some of my experiences in written
form. Ideally, I would like to produce a few technical and non-technical blog posts to share my insights from working on
this project with someone else.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say how far along my friend and I will get, but my hope is that we will complete this project and come out with something
to show for it (ideally with all of our features being completely implemented and having some kickass renders to show for 😄).
I am going to elaborate more on this project in a future post, but if this has piqued your interest</p>
