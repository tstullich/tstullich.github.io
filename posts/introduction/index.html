        <p>Thanks for being here! As this is my first blog post, I would like to introduce myself and set the
expectations of what you, the reader, can expect from this blog.</p>
<h2 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?<a href="#who-am-i" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>My name is Tim Stullich and I am a Software Developer based out of Berlin, Germany. I started off
my journey in Computer Science when I began my Bachelor&rsquo;s studies at San Jose State University in 2010. During my undergraduate years I mainly focused on Software Development towards mobile applications
and writing web services. After receiving my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree, I spent some time working at
Amazon Web Services as a Software Developer before moving back to Germany to study for a Master&rsquo;s
degree. Now that I have recently completed my studies, I am currently looking for work and decided
to spend my trying out some new hobbies, such as starting a blog.</p>
<p>As this is my first foray into &ldquo;creative&rdquo; writing since my undergrad years, there are bound to be some
growing pains as I continue to try to improve my content. I do not consider myself an excellent
writer, so if you have any constructive feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out to me with
suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation<a href="#motivation" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>This website is meant to serve two general purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a learning tool for myself and anyone interested in the topics I write about</li>
<li>A centralized portfolio of my work which others can draw inspiration from</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, I am going to write on topics that currently hold my interest, with the hopes that someone
will stumble across this blog at some point and gain some useful knowledge from it. Because I am also
fairly new to the computer graphics space, information on this blog might not be 100% accurate,
although I will give my best to present accurate information in my posts.</p>
<h3 id="post-frequency">Post Frequency<a href="#post-frequency" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Because I may not always have time to dedicate myself to writing, the frequency with which I post
is going to be fairly sporadic. I am going to aim to publish at least one article a month, but
I do not intend to keep that as a hard requirement. I want to create content that I would enjoy
reading myself so I want to stick to the &ldquo;quality over quantity&rdquo; mantra.</p>
