        <h2 id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>For my first technical post I wanted to write about a topic that I have been
trying to improve myself in for quite some time - Vulkan. Compared to other APIs
that interface with GPUs, Vulkan chooses to be overly explicit to give programmers
full control of how their application behaves. This extra verbosity makes the API
very appealing for writing high-performance applications, because the device driver will
have to deal with less overhead when running the appliction on the GPU.</p>
<p>However, this comes with the caveat that a lot more boilerplate code is
required from the user to configure a rendering pipeline. So if you are a newcomer to Vulkan and
have attempted to write your own renderer using Vulkan, you must have quickly realized
how much code it takes to even get a single triangle rendered on screen.</p>
<p>Personally, this was always a large barrier to entry for learning Vulkan, but
after a couple of running starts I believe I have finally overcome this problem.
Now I want to make it easier for other newcomers to developing applications for Vulkan.</p>
<p>This is why I have created a small <em>sandbox</em> application, which is just a very basic version
of Vulkan application that should allow anyone to get started writing Vulkan code.
The codebase includes all of the logic to create a graphics pipeline
with Vulkan to render a triangle on screen and also integrates <em>Dear ImGui</em> as
a programmable GUI which can be used later on to interact with the application. My hope
is that this will eliminate some of the initial hesitation for people who want
to learn Vulkan.</p>
<p>This post is going to become a part of a series of entries that will describe how
I approached the writing of deferred Vulkan renderer, so stay tuned for future posts.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites<a href="#prerequisites" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I am going to assume that you have familiarized yourself with some of the terminology
from the Vulkan API and have experience writing a C++ application. I will not
be going into all of the technical details for Vulkan or Dear ImGui, so if you
want to read up on any topics discussed in this post I recommend you take a look at the
<a href="#references">References</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation<a href="#installation" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>For the installation I am going to assume you are working in a Linux environment,
but all of the instructions should be easily transferable to other platforms.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies<a href="#dependencies" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>I tried to keep the number of dependencies as low as possible, so that it is easy
for any user to tailor the codebase to their own needs. However, in order to compile
the code right off the bat you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A C++14 compiler toolchain</li>
<li>CMake (3.16)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/">Vulkan SDK</a> (1.2)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> (3.3)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these dependencies are mandatory except for GLFW, which can be swapped out
for another preferred cross-platform I/O handling library.</p>
<h3 id="building">Building<a href="#building" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Once you have installed all of the necessary dependencies you can download a copy
of the repository or clone it using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">git clone https://github.com/tstullich/vk-sandbox
</code></pre></div><p>After the download finishes change to the root of the repository, where
you can build the source code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
</code></pre></div><p>If everything was built correctly, the <code>renderer</code> binary should be contained within the
<code>/build/cmake-build-debug/src</code> directory.</p>
<p>One important last step is to compile the GLSL shaders into SPIR-V binaries, which need
to be loaded by the renderer at runtime. Contained within the <code>shaders/</code> directory is a
script called <code>compile.sh</code> that can be executed to compile the shaders. The script uses the
<code>glslangValidator</code> from the Vulkan SDK, so make sure that the binary is visible through
your $PATH variable. The compiled .spv binary files should be contained within the same
directory, if the compilation was successful.</p>
<p>Now you should have everything in place to run the program. Executing the renderer binary
from the root directory should give you an output window with a triangle and UI as shown
below.</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="/img/hello-triangle.png"  alt="Vulkan Renderer"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center" >The first Vulkan triangle and Dear ImGui</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<h2 id="code-structure">Code Structure<a href="#code-structure" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The code for the renderer is located in <code>application.h</code> and <code>application.cpp</code> and is purposefully
kept in one class, so that it is easy to overview all of the components. This should
also make it easier to break up the components to be more compartmentalized in the future.
The logic in the code revolves mainly around initializing all of the necessary components
for the Vulkan pipeline and UI, and then running a rendering loop until the user exits
the program. What follows is a brief description of what goes into these parts.</p>
<h3 id="initialization">Initialization<a href="#initialization" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Within the <code>Application</code> constructor lies the entry point to all of the logic that is
needed to initialize the renderer. Starting off the initialization process is the <code>initVulkan</code>
function that contains all of the logic for setting up the Vulkan pipeline.</p>



  <div class="collapsable-code">
    <input id="1" type="checkbox"  />
    <label for="1">
      <span class="collapsable-code__language">cpp</span>
      <span class="collapsable-code__title">initVulkan()</span>
      <span class="collapsable-code__toggle" data-label-expand="Show" data-label-collapse="Hide"></span>
    </label>
    <pre class="language-cpp" ><code>
void Application::initVulkan() {
    createInstance();
    setupDebugMessenger();
    createSurface();
    physicalDevice = pickPhysicalDevice();
    getDeviceQueueIndices();
    createLogicalDevice();
    createSwapchain();
    createImageViews();
    createRenderPass();
    createGraphicsPipeline();
    createFramebuffers();
    createCommandPool();
    createCommandBuffers();
    createSyncObjects();
    createDescriptorPool();
}
</code></pre>
  </div>


<p>Some components have a strict dependency on one another, so the ordering of the function calls is quite
important. Although I had Vulkan&rsquo;s validation layers enabled from the start, some errors could not
be caught by them. This led to segmentation faults at runtime, which would occur when passing invalid
Vulkan handles to <code>vkCreate()</code> functions.</p>
<p>However, the Vulkan API is designed to follow strictly the same function call pattern,
which makes it easy to handoff the necessary data. All of the renderer&rsquo;s <code>createSomething()</code>
functions follow more or less the same pattern of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a VK_COMPONENT struct</li>
<li>Fill the struct with the necessary data</li>
<li>Hand off the information struct to a <code>vkCreate()</code> function</li>
<li>Check the <code>VK_RESULT</code> if the function call succeeded</li>
</ul>
<p>This repeated pattern is also the source of the great amount of boilerplate code. If you take a
closer look at the code, you will find that a majority of it is occupied with creating and
setting the data fields of the structs provided by the Vulkan API. This might be intimidating at
first if you are unfamiliar with the API, but once you spend some time writing the code it
actually becomes an easily repeated pattern.</p>
<h3 id="loading-shaders">Loading Shaders<a href="#loading-shaders" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>A class to load SPIR-V shader code can also be found in <code>shaderloader.h</code>. Make sure to recompile
the shaders if any changes are made to them. There is a way to hook the execution of the shader
compile script into the build process using CMake, but at the time of writing this post this
is not supported by the sandbox.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface<a href="#user-interface" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Getting Dear ImGui setup was trickier than writing the code for the renderer.
The documentation for Dear ImGui is quite scattered and at times nonexistent, so finding
reliable information on how to integrate the library with Vulkan took more time than expected.
Luckily, I came across François Guthmann&rsquo;s blog, which has a lot of useful information on
how to solve this problem. I have linked it below in the <a href="#references">References</a> section if you
are interested in more details.</p>
<p>The <code>initUI</code> function contains all of the logic initialize Dear ImGui for rendering.</p>



  <div class="collapsable-code">
    <input id="1" type="checkbox"  />
    <label for="1">
      <span class="collapsable-code__language">cpp</span>
      <span class="collapsable-code__title">initUI()</span>
      <span class="collapsable-code__toggle" data-label-expand="Show" data-label-collapse="Hide"></span>
    </label>
    <pre class="language-cpp" ><code>
void Application::initUI() {
    IMGUI_CHECKVERSION();
    ImGui::CreateContext();
    ImGui::StyleColorsDark();

    // Initialize some DearImgui specific resources
    createUIDescriptorPool();
    createUIRenderPass();
    createUICommandPool(&amp;uiCommandPool,
                        VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT);
    createUICommandBuffers();
    createUIFramebuffers();

    // Provide bind points from Vulkan API
    ImGui_ImplGlfw_InitForVulkan(window, true);
    ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo init_info = {};
    init_info.Instance = instance;
    init_info.PhysicalDevice = physicalDevice;
    init_info.Device = logicalDevice;
    init_info.QueueFamily = queueIndices.graphicsFamilyIndex;
    init_info.Queue = graphicsQueue;
    init_info.DescriptorPool = uiDescriptorPool;
    init_info.MinImageCount = imageCount;
    init_info.ImageCount = imageCount;
    ImGui_ImplVulkan_Init(&amp;init_info, uiRenderPass);

    // Upload the fonts for DearImgui
    VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer = beginSingleTimeCommands(uiCommandPool);
    ImGui_ImplVulkan_CreateFontsTexture(commandBuffer);
    endSingleTimeCommands(commandBuffer, uiCommandPool);
    ImGui_ImplVulkan_DestroyFontUploadObjects();
}
</code></pre>
  </div>


<p>The main realization I had to make was that Dear ImGui requires a number of extra resources,
that were not immediately available in my initial code. Dear ImGui requires the user
to setup an extra set of framebuffers, a render pass, and command buffers which in turn
required the allocation of a command and descriptor pool. I was under the impression that I
could reuse my command buffers and integrate some extra logic into the main render pass
to make Dear ImGui work, but this is not the case. Without these resources the renderer
would repeatedly crash at runtime, which was frustrating to debug.</p>
<p>Once the extra resources had been created, integrating the UI into the rendering loop was
quite simple. All that had to be done was to fill out the <code>ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo</code>
struct and call the corresponding Dear ImGui helper functions, which took over the
rest of the initialization.</p>
<h3 id="rendering-loop">Rendering Loop<a href="#rendering-loop" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Now that all the necessary components are setup and ready to run, the main rendering loop
takes over. With the bulk of the code being dedicated to initializing the state of the
Vulkan pipeline, it should come as no surprise that the actual rendering portion is
comparatively short. The rendering loop is triggered through the <code>run</code> function, where we
poll GLFW for any input events from the keyboard, build the UI components in <code>drawUI</code> and eventually
reach the <code>drawFrame</code> function, which contains the main logic to render and present one frame.</p>
<p>Drawing a frame requires the following operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait for the current frame&rsquo;s fences</li>
<li>Acquire the next presentable image from the swapchain</li>
<li>Mark the current image as being in use</li>
<li>Record Dear ImGui&rsquo;s command buffer</li>
<li>Submit the command buffers to the graphics queue</li>
<li>Submit the image to the presentation queue</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are then executed at each loop iteration until the user exits the program.</p>

<p>Hopefully this post has given you a broad overview of what it takes to get started in writing
a Vulkan application. Of course there is more code in the sandbox that I have not touched on,
but at least you should be comfortable in navigating the code and have a feeling for the
structure of a Vulkan application. If you have any questions, drop a comment below and I will
try to answer it as soon as possible.</p>
